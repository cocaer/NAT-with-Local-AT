what a fish .
not very sustainable .
that &apos;s actually me .
incredibly exciting .
very different term concepts .

but essential .
so they al .
and she did .

and that was fascinating .
that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what was the result ?
but you know what ?
pretty good , right ?
yeah , i know .
&apos;s no normal .
oh , one .
that &apos;s very good .
already a few more .
he opens the door .
why not live longer ?
it has sensors .
here &apos;s the video .
you could see manhattan .
so they knew everything .
it &apos;s general .
i was amazed .
banis blank blank .
but you know what ?
&apos;s happened here ?
centers have up been built .
i don &apos;t know .
and that &apos;s important .
evalreview it uate them it again .
hey , why not ?
1,000 , very good .
&apos;s happened here ?
these people make money .
these days are over .
can we change it ?
this is the last .
flying cat .
yeah , it does .
what is media today ?
we can do differently .
and it must be back back .
not school management .
don &apos;t call him .
and i was artist .
that &apos;s a wish .
bg : thank you .
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
why do we do that ?
it &apos;s not a country .
because you know what ?
how do we that ?
so it &apos;s true .
so where do we go ?
you can go in .
i have a question .
that would be okay .
how you are .
so how does it work ?
they use their hands .
i think that .
i was thinking about it .
i don &apos;t think so .
what do need ?
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
so let &apos;s see .
ash . &quot;
so they do it .
players aren &apos;t sitting around .
i was standing with him .
okay . thank you .
here &apos;s an example .
so she was back .
and i kept working .
that &apos;s this happens to us today .
what do you want to do ?
let me tell you .
oh . a moment .
why does this ever ?
we need energy wonder .
there are two choices .
i &apos;m going into go in here .
or before the bombs .
but i kept working .
not toxic in it .
you see it immediately .
thank you .
they even hurt themselves .
why should we do that ?
thank you for listening .
he &apos;s not going to do that .
i &apos;m .
i swear love it .
it feels like &apos;s really enjoit feels great .
i children .
here &apos;s another example .
i &apos;m a writer .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
but the wrong things .
it &apos;s against justice .
&apos;s no food .
a challenge .
and i understand that .
people going crazy .
the data came in .
but it didn &apos;t have .
maybe 10 times as many .
be a mentor .
thank you very much .
so here you see it here .
but it &apos;s even worse .
jk : both .
out the camera .
yeah . all right .
i created one .
first , mit .
after just a one journey there .
my gut reception feeling again .
what creates the illusion ?
and so it was .
very expensive real estate .
and i always had .
does anybody see anything something particular ?
give pee a chance .
is not proteprotection .
fortunately , not , yes ?
in china , it was different .
you compare ing comparison .
i mean the soul .
what would all be done ?
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
and why is that ?
i agree with .
yes , there here it is .
he had the experience .
there &apos;s an old study .
dk : 60,000 .
i think it doesn i don &apos;t .
some of them have come and left .
ooh , thank you .
will i like the color ?
good day , everybody together .
so you see the city .
he loved it very much .
they did secretly .
and it got better .
an almost identical structure .
is that your mind ?
that &apos;s a great question .
it keep you fresh .
that &apos;s a great question .
my name is amit .
just carry on . lots of fun .
and the answer is no .
okay , a few more .
let me wrap up up .
there were remixes .
and then it became international .
ohh .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
is it photography even ?
so here &apos;s another example .
there &apos;s something else too else .
did you see these guys ?
it has billions of them .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
i &apos;ll never forget that .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our fight .
it would be unbeviable .
crisis . death . disaster .
and many people forget this .
i felt really good .
and then it happened again .
he always there .
they were still fish .
we have three main groups .
there are online criminals .
privacy has given .
so what does that mean ?
so what does that mean ?
be disorder fied .
invent his own story .
how do we actually work ?
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
but where are we useful ?
the work of interpret .
that &apos;s tial .
&apos;t call him too .
but what eat ?
i don &apos;t like that .
first we have the population .
who will ensure it ?
now what do you think ?
he &apos;s paul offit .
it &apos;s not emotions .
the game is from 2007 .
i want to ask you something .
i wanted stay healthy .
who are these relative ?
so what happened after years ?
i had a good life .
you see the water coming .
that &apos;s the bit .
i grew up in india .
is it about light ?
they look like this .
i was devaged ated .
the world &apos;s only country .
i think that find this fascinating .
i think that find this fascinating .
and luckily he not die .
i will stop that .
why not think about it that ?
you see this there .
you have to &apos;s also got understand that .
most know know .
we need to spread out the message .
you don &apos;t you to do that ?
this sounds crazy , right ?
will have my size ?
his name is tempt .
what am i looking at ?
that &apos;s it &apos;s something like .
but what do we do that ?
and this opens a map .
we &apos;re constantly hitting together .
it would be safe .
we love technology and creativity .
he went up and down .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
that &apos;s felix .
they didn &apos;t have books .
so what do we need to do ?
conflicts conflict emerges creativity .
or is it be possible ?
he &apos;s the guy on left .
they can &apos;t have bones .
so we are too many .
we &apos;ve been 20 people .
it may sound really bad cious .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
i &apos;ll get to the end .
this is what the graph looked like .
what else can we do ?
what &apos;s the soul ?
i can say it all .
we &apos;re not don &apos;t create anymore .
very scary .
it &apos;s abundant sting technology .
they called me .
but i felt worse .
they really loved it .
the orange one orange tractor .
so what happened ?
and then they put set them up .
it works like this .
the key thing is ...
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
so what how about fitness ?
these changes are coming in .
one place is south korea .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
i don &apos;t have to !
the answer is &quot; yes .
they could have done better .
like that , you know .
what &apos;s one is this thing ?
this was christmas .
so , why hacking ?
so it &apos;s the circle .
does you that curious ?
because you can train that .
and how did it feel ?
my wife told me her .
it &apos;s a natural thing .
again , you have it again .
thank you for your attention .
i only loved one two .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
i wanted to support them .
you want to feed the world ?
who &apos;s most successful ?
the same thing , just .
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and finally , episosignificancal meaning .
let &apos;s face -- who &apos;s normal ?
well i was the next .
first extension , second .
they saw the big enimpact .
and then everybody went down .
i took awe .
that was the beginning of the journey .
but it was very sad .
and it worked very well .
that &apos;s &apos;s very risky .
tell me about this world .
and it took 18 months .
i see this plsign .
this picture is from this place .
think about your own decisions .
okay , there are a few .
her mother left her alone .
they connected these two people .
but they do the job .
sometimes i push too push too much too much .
it &apos;s the crux .
the answer is no .
so let me remember you .
is rational ?
that &apos;s god know ?
this is a game for outside .
for example , this perception in the context .
anybody know what that is ?
credit recognition should work .
it was just not invented yet .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
they always say , . why ?
there can &apos;t be a problem .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
2.5 percent thing to one , great .
he said , &quot; yes . &quot;
so they saw something magical .
it was a huge success .
so that &apos;s the good news .
they feel that way . &quot;
we &apos;re everybody &apos;s talking about happiness .
they haven &apos;t changed history .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
so , we can .
how many people would choose to creativity ?
is this all just education ?
now how could that happen ?
play is not weird .
the data wasn available before .
you can have that cloud .
she did for three years .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the power plant can explode .
i shouldn &apos;t say that .
they come from the artists .
and again , it showed him four .
they are are all important opportunities . &quot;
well , let &apos;s do we want .
what &apos;s happened that day ?
the story is not over .
no had never been an opportunity .
sometimes , the perspective is the illusion .
how can we help you ? &quot;
but it &apos;s not so so fast .
so what &apos;s next step ?
that made me really sad .
it &apos;s not our country .
and there &apos;s good news .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
and there are hundreds of them .
i memoreverything .
she was back and die .
she shares her experiences with others .
my name is brian goldman .
he actually gathercollecting fish .
it was my first ssunburn rate fire .
people were still happy .
let be you kogi . &quot;
everybody needs a goldfish glass .
we depend on two countries .
and we &apos;ll record take up .
so not like detox .
at the moment , it &apos;s gis age .
an autistic student .
it doesn &apos;t &apos;t have that soul .
and here &apos;s &apos;s again .
and of course , that &apos;s incredibly incredible work .
doesn &apos;t taste very good
i almost never cook .
so , it &apos;s a big challenge .
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
what should our teclaim for look like ?
i mean , i &apos;m journalist .
take nothing but granted .
and he actually says that way .
so paul is a terrorist .
no one ever said before .
the data gives it shows all the time .
they have so much insecurity .
they create an epstory .
which one would you like the most ?
and this was 19 years ago .
play doesn &apos;t just mean child games .
but i buy nothing new .
in the morning , before the game .
italy wins . yeah .
the whole building was made of water .
they can play with different kinds .
and then something weird happened .
what other brands do this ?
now this is one of the images .
they basically do the same thing .
and then we did that .
we went to an area .
is it , simple .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now it &apos;s 2.3 million .
i talk a lot about these questions .
that was granted ous .
the white lines are for the population .
but , you know what ?
i started to feel better .
but there are two problems there .
we can &apos;t get it .
and it was an incredible experience .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
so the question is how ?
and that &apos;s are too many .
every waste is nutrient .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
and they have a problem .
there are four and a half thousand people live .
it just &apos;t technological .
he showed the algae .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
what lessons have we learned ?
it has the greatest impact .
underneath other things shouldn should be suffering from er .
and then realizing it .
anybody does anybody in here here ?
they become are becoming free going to be open-the computers .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
somehow , don &apos;t do anymore .
we all love baseball , right ?
and she beat a 257 .
my second mistake was worse .
once we started this life alive .
okay , that &apos;s really makes courage .
and then i can transfer the whole thing .
they can &apos;t store energy .
and the form is role .
that would not been a problem at all .
further than beyond that , we can &apos;t do that .
what are you trying to &quot;
somehow it doesn &apos;t way that works way , right ?
slowly , but it certainly did .
get more and more like to you .
because i can say everything .
this is all metadata .
we use the energy of the sun .
i &apos;ll give you something .
and it starts with a physician .
maybe even in our cell phones .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
the nurse the nurse did tly .
now it &apos;s &apos;s easy to have .
creativity had to keep out some way .
i really wanted to work work normal .
i was a little bit of technology .
so i went to the court .
we can &apos;t do that .
when the judge saw me .
so i &apos;m going to show you now .
also an interesting phenomenon .
next , nuclear power .
that sounds ing .
that &apos;s scary .
hmmm , my brand ?
let &apos;s take for leave that .
is completely distrivital sting .
sions , right ?
but we need that all .
but really very effective , right ?
the movement the reason to write it .
i tried something more interesting .
dark urine . dark .
so , what kind the story of a story ?
i remember my first firm fire .
just be who you are .
what risky ?
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
thank you for very ence .
her family together .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
you can &apos;t do anything like that .
do you want to jewish with jeans ?
the truth is more like this .
and that really is the very beginning .
anyway , they do not to navigate .
otherwise you can &apos;t have any teeth .
so you can &apos;t solve this at all .
we say sustainability in germany .
how and what did he feel ?
because it for me , it means memory .
it &apos;s like the learning learning .
have you ever been jealous dish ?
i &apos;m shootthrough my head .
yeah , that &apos;s like the data .
and then we said , &quot; okay .
so i just started playing out to play .
and &apos;s really changed the dynamic dynamic .
so , see happens .
so the correlation is low
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
what about longevity ?
is it going to less than 20 dollars ?
the game is start -- silence .
and this video is video in real time .
isn &apos;t that overming ?
that &apos;s game , right ?
it didn &apos;t make sense in my mind .
i went to jail -- hard .
i like things that are different .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
all adults were all aware of the risks .
it expandspreads spreading out rapidly .
it can know where we are .
why did i go to medicine ?
it &apos;s not being documented .
they sell certificates .
and there are several reasons for this .
we started doing about 15 years ago .
sunlight and co2 is a method .
i think they find it disgusting urous .
this picture ded me of something .
it &apos;s on the book and on the picture .
does anybody know what three seconds is
we can regain our nutrients .
now , that &apos;s the minimum .
you can , i was there .
when you get to that , right ?
that has to be the of age .
and yet it &apos;s still not an interpretation .
so the first step in an interpretation .
you know what &apos;s wrong ?
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
so how far do you get there ?
music is medicine . music is changing us .
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
they flooded ated the chances els .
that &apos;s i &apos;ll stop that , thank you very much .
i could draw . i could paint .
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
anyway , we need a solution .
there &apos;s another reason though .
and that can make a big difference .
it doesn &apos;t have to do with science .
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
five million people use it every month .
but what will happen in come to the future ?
these are they &apos;re going to be tive .
and you know what i learned ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
do we really want to this way ?
you can do it all the time .
but the truth is far from it .
he can only use his eyes .
i really like to really cbeautiful clothing thes .
you see something fun here .
it seemed to be it was quite popular .
this is a picture of the object .
so we &apos;ve measured his movement .
now , that &apos;s not quite right .
something was coming into inside me .
oh , my time is already has gone over time ?
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
and these are the neural structures .
so this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
they &apos;re an inpersonality .
but maybe &apos;s not the case .
because we &apos;re living on a planet .
baseball is full of great statistics .
i don &apos;t take the line .
i &apos;m the new defined doctor .
been genesed .
privacy is not about the debate .
lego , made it possible for everyone .
our magazines are read by millions .
a has got these benefits these risks .
these rivers are taking very rapidly .
this is on the storards .
here he &apos;s the sun up here .
was a pretty good project .
i want to prove this you .
and what does that it mean for the designer ?
it makes leukemia in children .
he &apos;s been for already in &apos; over his age 0s .
that sounds very different before .
no , no , it can &apos;t work .
i fell in love with this fish .
do this for the kids ? &quot;
there are a billion people will be starve today .
now i see greg lemoon .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
architects and engineers , ily .
i &apos;m putting my sleeping back .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m holding the knife in my hand .
no , i mean it really serious .
and then we can all this whole positive feedback .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
so this crazy story true .
who doesn &apos;t want healthier ?
we won a few awards .
and i had to go of from the city .
okay , you really want to know that ?
that was more emphasion .
you want to orient in the museum ?
but then you really want to go deep down .
it &apos;s to to fill the experience .
here &apos;s her march brand of the gang .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
we need to increase the complexity .
for a year we had a cent .
her father died at the she was after her birth was born .
the defeat line would have been too simple .
who would ever wish for one ?
but it takes a lot of planning .
and i jump every morning .
we didn &apos;t write this this app .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
now we it with airplanes .
i &apos;ve learned from my grandmother .
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
i started with my usual talk .
it &apos;s about transformational able standards .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
the stones are coded .
it &apos;s for longer than those these other two networks .
and often , in the third of the , they forgot there forget it .
and it depends on phosphorus .
it &apos;s like we from north .
we can reinvet invent it everything again .
so i started up an an institute .
that &apos;s how natural things are introduced .
automatically , it walks to the mind .
they &apos;re called ers .
it &apos;s about it insanity .
that &apos;s how it &apos;s coming come .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
and it was that blew me so crazy this ...
&apos;s ideology , not science .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad thing .
we &apos;ve been warcraft since 1994 .
i call this the glowing ting tient .
what are you going to do ? &quot;
we need to think which brands .
the film has not been exposed yet .
they &apos;re even bring in funding .
here &apos;s the olive oil .
who do you want to inform ?
oh my god . oh my god .
who could have predicted ved this happen ?
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
these are the apsaras .
my brother at me .
this may be transmitted in public .
we have a lot of running around going on .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
the risk is not a simple game .
but i &apos;m going you a question .
bin .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
everybody in this room needs to be in .
the result of this it was catastrophic .
happily yful productivity . fantastic !
we &apos;ve reached achieved a some sort of equilibrium .
thank you , but the best part still &apos;s coming .
they gave their blood pressure .
the living legacy feeds to the sts .
i don &apos;t know who recognican see what stands something .
the urine .
to ask , what &apos;s thing ?
there are also world record there well .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
in which words what would you say a to describe food ban ?
ment very well .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
and that &apos;s what nobody seems up .
all of will generations need a few milliseconds .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
i thought that of this for energy .
and that &apos;s where you feel it .
these things are logically correct .
the students are divided by in des .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
he &apos;s interested in fireworks .
he signed .
so here you have this little mechanism .
let &apos;s do little interference .
tell you what you feel .
they were shotrthrough each other .
and you can see how the building works .
completely reis set up to on a particular goal .
he died , broken through the history .
she &apos;s going to deeply .
you &apos;re always rare animals .
we &apos;ve built the unique elements here .
that sounds unusual .
the byproduct is clean water .
so there are circles .
most importantly importantly , when already died .
i hope you &apos;re &apos;ll give me .
&quot; the best part in the industry . &quot;
they literally have turned ped the lever .
it &apos;s been constant constant before far .
so that &apos;s a hard t .
they have them . they always have them .
what do you think , happens next ?
widesour ties are just belong to our lives .
it cost 7 billion .
let &apos;s start with realito perceive ving .
it turns off the engine works .
so means not mean that optimistic .
&apos;ve brought your bring their pictures , right ?
i think that &apos;s really cool .
politically , ly everybody applaud ed everybody .
now we saw the reverse effect .
he went back to the silence .
so i followed my gut feeling .
we worked up were working too worked till until late at night .
so scott gets this fruit .
maybe you take may lead to run some of some mutations .
they kept us to be by being inspired .
i re people in death cells .
that i had crazy things .
now , look at this curve .
we &apos;re going through initiarituals .
they are the people &apos;s countries .
these are the mobile phones in the future .
are all incentive sing questions .
it &apos;s about a supply of america .
we need get a long way far , and it &apos;s , very quickly &apos;s fast .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do do .
so , from modern to the computer society .
you &apos;ll at see from the from the back to front .
a dalmadrer , right
and that &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
and the curiosity can &apos;t be not to learn .
that &apos;s just a little bit ar less destruction .
so that &apos;s men can &apos;t be pigs .
we can support them to be good .
we can support them to be good .
but with the design , we go .
the mechanism is coming from from the lie .
you &apos;re behind the mountains , and so forth .
we also got very rate data .
this will be in going to happen next april .
he was shaking ok his head , no .
it was really , really profound .
we &apos;re talking about it in it tally .
that &apos;s the truth . i think that is i believe .
this is &quot; the world without oil . &quot;
i &apos;ll read you the mission .

something very strange thing happens is happening here .
you should also want to wish for you .
what are these going to bring these three billion people ?
we &apos;re expecting expect a few for some extraordinary decades .
and that &apos;s what i was feeling .
but i kept asking myself questions .
that &apos;s this is the system we live in .
i &apos;m a human being . i &apos;m making mistakes .
she &apos;s not drunk
but today now we &apos;re far beyond that .
they tap into cking their internet connection .
156 million countries are sending our television channel .
and this picture picture was taken by atlas .
no , no , far missing missing .
maybe you need have a look back again .
by saying alone , what is information ?
i see the dalmadrer .
what will take &apos;s five twent05 million seconds take ?
the thing that was just represented .
so that &apos;s a tricky fied part .
you put box .
the chef had cook it .
i &apos;m an experfor relationships . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
this is an ecological network .

and even lomborg thinks around .
had never been a time like this .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;ve ared .
does anybody ever anyone know what that is ?
it &apos;s not even the truth going to get it it .
we les in this country .

we can give ourselves something like this .
we &apos;re still to those people later .
we have states of these don &apos;t exist .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to with me . &quot;
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
and that was the outbreak of the break off .
now tempt is now zed today .
make it possible -- all of you here .
tell me a little bit about that part .
you can be logical and intuitive .
there &apos;s another aspect in history .
and i &apos;d like want to read them to you .
did an old-fashioned version version of this .
i lived was in parallel alleworlds .
&quot; you didn &apos;t let you out . &quot;
the bank is from another place .
this is a modest humble p .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
so it comes very a feedback back .
it can know how to it .
i &apos;ve learned a few very simple things .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
maybe i did a good good reason .
they &apos;re six about two inches .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
so littlens its is open source .
now this level of intuition is becoming becomes very important .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
this is an nual dial flow .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
he has to do that as a present .
i &apos;m going to try this in a you through an a little bit an example .
his personal impression of the seerosion .
it &apos;s a particularly story , i mean .
and then he can just there .
because now you can use a three-.
and you can see the whole again .
ragging i ? i was totally confused .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
there are a lot things that need to get .
you process the process , you understand it .
the guy in the middle much .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
because we don &apos;t want to push genes around ?
what does this look like ? pretty good .
and we get a very flat line .
thank you , danny kahneman .
but it &apos;s not just the words .
we don &apos;t know exactly happening .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
you see on melthe line .
the whole goal of the entire is transparency .
a a whole cool of cool whip whiws eat .
i &apos;m going will negotiate ate directly with the artist .

and you see roberto dancing .
i &apos;m very important a lot of important to an artist as an context .
normal people are access to these devices . &quot;
it &apos;s all coming from our own pockets .

and the list can you can &apos;t endlessly .
now , , what are archmodels ?
it &apos;s more like more norm more like that .
now , everybody ever eating a cake .
and there &apos;s a central thing to this .
no , we &apos;re finding out sure what &apos;s inside .
so , can you can play it in me in blue ?
you say there are no ers .
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
so , that really blew my out .
if you burn the natural gas , no .
you know that science is not a company .
and let me start with with an example .
people were suffering . people were fought .
dumunfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
maybe we can see enof kindness gality as a change .
raise your hands up . let me see .
just think of that for a moment .
i &apos;m not sure where we go &apos;re going .

you just need to spread it as far as you can .
you walk around you and you &apos;re feeling .
you can easily in and zoom in .
that &apos;s about . thank you .
we &apos;re thinking about about energy scarcity of energy .
i call it &quot; the next billion . &quot;
it &apos;s called a .
let me show you how they work .
you just listen to listening , and then they to speak speak .
the official dogma of what ?
three : third , escalation of expectations .
and the is that they have too little .
they were laughing more than her do do here .
the new chromosome went into the cell .

if you don &apos;t , you know someone today .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
now i &apos;m adding add a it .
now , if you think a little bit .
and the two here today .
now you can see the dalmaid er .
this is the so-og model model .
shame the environment , you use less energy .
because what it &apos;s to it , right ?
you can dive into one year .
you can jump right directly to a particular certain output .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning into into information . &quot;
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
and there &apos;s the charging problem .
my parents are the way in the 80 .
we &apos;ve ff .

i &apos;ve tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to restore health after a disease .
and that now , this &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
thursesday : self-confidence is the key .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
but reality is always unpredictable .
it was something that we knew to do .
you want to something about my brand .
you can get two ways -- very simple .
it suits to be a thousand square miles .
the third technology : categorization .
my fourth technique technology : the e tion for complexity .
my grandmother has never let me forget his life .
but so many years , have been helping over the years .
life hadn &apos;t changed for the centuries .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
but it has an unexpected turn .
and let me show you a simple example .
i &apos;m working in the industry .
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition .
i said , &quot; okay , okay grandmother . &quot;
well , i into the court .
so here &apos;s is the chance there &apos;s a chance of the opportunity to do something .
i remember it was yesterday .
the three words were : &quot; do you remember ?
we still think they were original .
i thought i could integrate .
so what the supermarket is .
here &apos;s some on the hamton .
now , this cartoon is few statements .
seriously -- i have know the failure . go !
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
and if not , dance your dance .
the permanent ice red with red .
anyway , they &apos;re doing in it .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
&apos;s going to being comparing in china in a second .
it &apos;s anything that &apos;s inside that is useful .
all of this is composable able .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go going to another on a slide again .
so goal was easy to say , okay .
and over time , they can react to another .
amazastonishing ingly , he was still delicious .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and i didn &apos;t let me that i was ged fied of that .
this has got to go all the way down , to zero .
the internet and its service is a miracle .
we need to be more research money .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
my grandparents put in pushed this number to 70 .
they were just like the people in this room .
we &apos;ve gone into of what didn &apos;t work .
shing . shame .
it &apos;s kind of a potatto to .
let me show you you from there
there &apos;s a lot of ing .
i don &apos;t get the feedback in real life .
what we want to do is to create the future .
we &apos;ve been here for about some around 3130,000 years .
that &apos;s about one percent of the total population .
so let &apos;s go ahead it . save the shoes .
intersexuality happens in a lot of different forms .
so that made sense , it fit together .
so again , this was fit really well together .
so this is where we need digital security systems .
and this is a million-dollar company .
eeee ! no , thank you .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
i think i may have heard more hands .
motors , motors geeks motors -- four possibilities .
nobody has be your ideas ideas .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
is it about the details , or the colors ?
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different pictures .
and is every piece of plank very well .
scott was talking about a conversation from talking about human human to human .
we &apos;re more than that , &apos;re citizens .
and yet , we seem to be happy with it .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and new conflict .
then he would whispered me into the to my ear .
what would you say to tell someone who believes believed that ?
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that too too .
and this is very important in the medical research .
there can be a sequence of changes .
this is alfred gonzalez .
what do you do certificate ?
way you can &apos;t to put them together way .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
at first , we have only signed .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
and we had to remove them , what we did .
you &apos;re all now back on your now .
now i &apos;m going to do a little more little more about this .
that the issue of ecology is a global .
there is &apos;s where every footprint is there .
picasso asks answering es , just wait a minute .
that &apos;s no one in the world yet .
natural light then offers the smart grid .
what &apos;s the food supply &quot;
every morning , they fly to 40 kilometers across miles per hour every farm .
and every evening night , they &apos;re 1fly 40 miles away
i &apos;m going to choose issue for government .
i was thrillexcited about the ed with science , you know .
they &apos;re living with the help of chemosynthesis .
that become a key part of this thing .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
let &apos;s pretend like we have a machine here .
i have to say i don &apos;t understand that .
somebody &apos;s sitting there who didn &apos;t have had any childhood .
so , i would take the needle .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
it was almost out of ely beyond the imagination .
the teachers didn &apos;t know something was changed .
it only the test of survival and success .
ladies and gentlemen , your relations .
so two couples , each one is &apos;s a baby .
so we have this horrible simplistic simplistic idea .
so i think we need to be leaders .
on the left -ght-hand side , you see a small boat .
what do you think what the answer will be ?
no one wanted didn &apos;t want to do with the movie .
these things have a more effect .
it &apos;s the way like to be .
the first is a classic , apple .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demonstration .
i mean , no one has &apos;s ever seen a particle .
for the rest of the time they &apos;re deleted alized .
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
it has a button on .
and then the next week , it &apos;s coming to the market .
today , a lot of people gave up the government .
and try to do the whole thing it with a again another generation .
storytelling is and more senses .
at first , i thought that would be a game .
and then i ask myself : how could this happen ?
and we &apos;re increasing our expectations all the time .
it &apos;s by oxygen and silicon .
and i went back to the work .
the question is , why do people accept this that ?
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
we &apos;ve trying to important questions .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
for example example , the sneaker , right ?
these sentences are perfectly logical and correct rect .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . &quot; i set up .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
they don &apos;t spend time in power in power power .
so what happened was we could do that .
and they &apos;re not going to die of masses .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
it was summer , and i had shorts .
and of course , it was click on .
i want to show you something very a little bit the first here .
that &apos;s they communicate -- this is &apos;s how your way your fingers .
so i spoke at a few months later .
i never want to move a life in life anymore .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
he &apos;s not come out in other countries .
the best part is still -- in a second .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
had to be another piece of puzzle .
that our contribution to the system is that .
at age 16 , i started illustrate books at books .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
and i have to say , there was some force
notice two things about this curve .
do you know what a ter ?
i hired them up and i went to the treatment .
it supports others talk about their mistakes .
and that argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and &apos;s packaging or or content .
so don &apos;t not save , don avoiavoid it .
so each concert is a different concert .
so the smart grid grids , a huge topic issue , anywhere ic everywhere .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
the last three of the five , i summariup .
that &apos;s a problem that a lot of players have .
and i &apos;m saying say that &apos;s good .
it started four and a half years ago in italy .
and we need make a on this device .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
actually , no , that was not wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
so , the issue of the day : money .
and yet still reves a realistic level .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
there are couple of very interesting things .
we want to do something about the death penalty .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
it &apos;s going to offer that for nine .
it was going to roll over the country .
i &apos;m really sorry . do this crazy ?
but it &apos;s definitely not an opsituation .
everybody who was of them , everybody was there all started to dividing .
he came up to me and he ged hug me .
now everybody &apos;s pattern is something to see something .
and i &apos;ll summarwrap this that just quickly for you .
it was a lot of went and in hurry .
we don develop identity , we invent them .
so it &apos;s supposed to go from the outside man .
come on , dance , with me . thank you .
at the beginning bal society by language .
i picked it pointed it out here .
there &apos;s mechanengineering is going cles as the same as well .
anyway , so i certainly want to
this is a dead turtle .
everyone in my neighborhood in neighborhood is away .
it has a molecular weight over 300 million .
this is a completely unsustainable pattern table of development .
you &apos;ve seen to see it in the news .
and in that was in mind , the memory was happening .
we &apos;ve understood that the weather is global .
and what &apos;s in there ?
in the countries where people are money .
so , we can &apos;t do these things too at all .
they &apos;ve reversed the flow of the water .
and that was incredibly exciting .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
would it be live good health ?
i have something i want to show you here .
so i think think that &apos;s what my brand .
restore it , digest rest the rest .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
so for him , they were just blaes .
the only thing they had was they had their head .
information is any difference that makes a difference .
these are all over the every , almost .
we &apos;ve already got percent in germany .
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do .
so , this was a very strange experience .
did you take this morning all your vitamins ?
there were no candidate talmelons .
as i said , amanda wearing our elephant .
they &apos;re both viable , both light .
i want to help calm down .
all right , what &apos;s the brand gerry ?
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because it doesn &apos;t really feel real money .
no apple has ever taped ched that like that again .
i was not &apos;t familiar with the label .
but what happens to people &quot; is different .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
so the scripmissing of dna was an interesting step .
the silence is iron creesating .
we want to reduce the number of prisons ders .
and we &apos;ve seen this in the mobile phones phones .
and to give me back to my physician cian .
one of the he had kidneys nightroney cks .
the headquarters is right here .
there are some that are much more spatial .
in fact , that coal is not dirty .
so here &apos;s some of people who test it .
yeah , so , what should be biohacking ?
that means we need to get phosphorus .
and we see that it &apos;s way .
if you fall in love with somebody someone , efficient ?
not all of course be composable .
but today we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems .
but maybe you might can do it with them .
these were the very first calculations , six years ago .
the flamingos are eeating the shrimp .
i think , the first place , curiosity .
it drives the u.s. for hundreds of years .
now they understood the advantage of the prototyping .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
this is an investment in africa for over the last 30 years .
there seems to be a there &apos;s an indisagreement .
now , would choose the same hovacation ?
what are the emotions that are able can be measured ?
i want to do it by not die . &quot;
and it &apos;s not just in the terms of gender .
but how do you do that in practice ?
here are the results that we &apos;ve just got .
so that you can understand the whole movement .
that &apos;s kind of like pry .
but otherwise , our problem would be even bigger .
do you know how many watching these tedtalks ?
the answer likely to be no .
they absolutely wanted nothing to do with the project .
and we found that it was really , really odd .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i told my mother , i couldn &apos;t do that .
so i think the principles are very simple .
i set up quit my job at 95 pounds .
good night , sweet thylacine rat . &quot;
so each droplet was a little bit different .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
and i am becoming me as a character in the book .
i remember it was yesterday .
we have access to access to the with an exponential technology .
all of these mistakes are inevitable .
so you don &apos;t the animal that often .
they get less because we catch them .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like this .
but falling is not always such a bad thing .
this is a period of six seconds .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets ts .
if your job is your dance is dance , dance .
and they also feel the ements and their tendency ke .
now he &apos;s taking a tractor into the scene .
i can do the sequence as it goes around walks .
or they didn &apos;t have photography .
the whole thing is a game . i have to say that .
it &apos;s sort of a behavior poop print .
and in my teencty , i said , expectation .
because the notes are the only connection to him directly .
interpretation is not rabout in beginner class .
to create a phrase with his own breath .
why do i have afford to afford the n this little car ?
he &apos;s not just faing you and not you .
because without this life we can &apos;t to life life .
because this is in fact , this is not interested in the evidence .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have anymore ?
that &apos;s great , we have a business model .
for nathaniel , music means for mental lonhealth .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
these stupid movies don &apos;t bring us any money .
today , i &apos;m going to you about energy and climate .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
it &apos;s really important important that we can get there .
the marshmallow has to be up there the top .
well , i understand that &apos;s what i do .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
and i have all kinds of little props around over here .
yeah , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
i &apos;m probably many of you in this room know about this trick .
... the doodtions also play also a role too .
and you ask , &quot; what happens to these with those moments ?
it &apos;s not about how happy person is alive .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
we don &apos;t want to try and say the future .
you see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
how could it be possible to do that ?
they &apos;re not don &apos;t talking about god and nature of god .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
and is the design behind stuxnet .
i want to tell you about how we out .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
so how exactly are we going to see waste in the movie ?
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
or are you like a down-attribute te ?
this is just online -- no press , no television
and then finally , we should to be transparency .
and that was a humility an experience .
in 2010 , it has been 23 million times .
and this all leads to us to a big question ...
i made the decision to move to the united states .
and that worked . applause for scott .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and we use this word with this of that .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
she had the last word in every word the fight fight .
assets , not debt , influences what the outcome .
well , really good , maybe a single an all-star .
i was a compulobsessional student .
and that wasn &apos;t &apos;t a hard to make diagnosis .
if you generalize it , this is here &apos;s what happens .
and we can navigate this very simple way way .
and the world that we lived in looked like this .
yeah , what kind of projects do we do now ?
they virtualize reality , without they have no without the computers .
aan age to the machine age .
i don &apos;t know who you know this picture .
i had a relationship with that beauty for several months .
you do something that &apos;s actually a different way .
of my passions were kind of flointerfed ed .
and so i made a little unusual decision .
there &apos;s a connection , there &apos;s a , you have another respect .
i thought , let &apos;s put in the same way .
but do you know , what you &apos;re not &apos;t right about ?
but one of them is much worse than the other .
you want to more extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
8,000 players playing the game for eight weeks .
but will we make the best from of our playboard drive ?
we see the same thing in the disabled legal ability movement .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
it &apos;s , and it &apos;s just natism cy .
&apos;s a lot of crazy things going on .
emc : &quot; you called they will welcome to transparency .
there we were , and this is the painting .
well , let me show you a more of it
you knew it was a a trick , right ?
but at the same time , we know that it possible .
we have all navigation systems in our cars .
and we want to bring this to a global scale .
this is the call center for service and information .
now we do this with drilling machines .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
we want to eliminate do mass . &quot;

&apos;s moore &apos;s law the last hundred years .
we have the passion of a diy innovator .
she barely breathed and she walked .
&apos;s the kind of a teacher shame .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
and so that not why &apos;s perceived as as a big loss .
if you want , it creates hyperlinks between the images .
now you know what the answer to that question is ?
i may have another 40 years in me .
we wanted to develop a language for language learner .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
but you &apos;re not going to replace the phosphorus .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
so we &apos;re going to leave before , and where are we going ?
and some of it worked and some didn &apos;t .
they need that , and we don &apos;t &apos;re not giving &apos;t give them .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
the people in the door are now coming in now .
i &apos;ll agree with that &apos;s logical .
would you want to become ctive and more confidence ?
the dog ! i was just out of my dlessly .
tuesday : adatation is completely ated .
it was &quot; in eterforever , forever . &quot;
a little bit more about them , they &apos;re &apos;re not you .
and how did that for you it succeed
we &apos;re very far away from target .
when i say reality , i mean photoreality .
the undersea water comes out of a quarry .
i &apos;m going to tell you about unexpected discovering ies .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
so there &apos;s a very nice little game dynamic .
kid in me really excited about these kinds of possibilities .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
important to me to unite together together .
there &apos;s a program that some people might have some familiar of .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing kids bring children to the world .
and we reinv&apos;re inventing many often as we want .
then i say , &quot; heart adjust pity , right ?
there &apos;s a nice example of this .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any difference a saying about the reality .
the main problem here is a like aids .
it &apos;s right , morality , paterent-making stuff .
and so after the same three months later .
we see this that in all sorts of human life .
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the anymore .
these are the people who that shape my world view .
my mother suffered had from alert ghtmarks on the boat .
and yet we don &apos;t understand the capabilities of it yet .
you know that he was here in 1835 .
i &apos;m very grateful for the here .
now luckily now , there &apos;s a lot of studies now .
why do i doing that ? what &apos;s next ? &quot;
this is the player &apos;s in front of an episoal victory .
these results have been been hard work for weeks of weeks .
another favorite picture of me , staring night .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .

... if so , you could show just slide the slide for a minute .
you can say things that are have the impact the world .
and i said , &quot; yeah , very you really much . &quot;
probably one of these numbers have to come close to zero .
and we learn trust and the rules of the game .
in fact , we know else is the case .
what we stayed left with us is the &quot; story &quot; . &quot;
we do these things to do a different examples .
once you do that , and then you get the sentence .
now , this is not &apos;t be a joke at all .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logically correct .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you tell about what &apos;s going on about .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
so please listen when a music is played .
and that &apos;s kind of how to take ke the message .
how many would you would choose a good memory ?
so just imagine two different kinds small changes here .
that &apos;s an idea that &apos;s worth spreading to spread .
well , it turns out that they &apos;re right .
so , go out and start inventing ent up .
go and jelles sarleonard cohen . &quot;
his whole process of changed after that .
and we like to go to look at this .
that means the ants weighs much more than us .
so that &apos;s the idea of the soul does .
so you could feel that you could sell selling it .
it &apos;s hard to overseminate the destruction .
it changed the of making films movies completely .

i said , promise , &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a completely denial of error .
every big picture is a the dawn of a section .
i &apos;m looking forward very excited to all of you .
and the third area , which actually explains to itself .
and then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s has been a change .

and movie is called &quot; the &quot; never ever . &quot;
and then we &apos;re offering to one of these great jees ts .
there &apos;s not even online it online . no streaming .
also , urban designer designers and farmers are very interested .
she &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the sticks bribe .
&quot; doesn can , &quot; it turns out to be true .
but that not the end of the thylacrats .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital hits the physical .
so this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
the cell communities were again , again started to abstract information .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of these communities .
but i really believe that think there &apos;s something coming after us .
30 years ago , this would have ridiculous .
now it &apos;s the red list of the dangerous list .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
in the future , of crime most crimes of the crime will play online .
and the question is , that good news or bad news ?
you &apos;t know anything possible in this goldglass . &quot;
i &apos;m also going to make a a second what &apos;s in there .
a research mester about on top of about natural interface .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
i &apos;m going to take it for you and then explain it .
there is no constant feedback in the real life .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
so we don &apos;t have a budget as any other things brands .
what other metamorphobes have ses did they went through ?
so you just go to google &apos;s the googingc.com .

i sold irs selling museum around the world .
and you can see that green dot spot there in the middle .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of &apos;s a hero of mine .
now , how do people die in a result of such a like this ?
these are spaces that can respond to a human .
so that &apos;s why so you think about a a weigh .
a manhattan ? how do we get there ?
one is the highest that &apos;ve seen .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my way like this .
that &apos;s not going works work for all berthe self-mind all .
so a lot testosterone , but it a don &apos;t respond response to that .
both cases would fall at me , and stop me up .
i can &apos;t play the same today as i do in 20 years .

so if claim cp says there &apos;s no soul .
i was pretty obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
many people talk are talking from an 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
we were just wandering around the same way we did .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and that &apos;s this our goal .
when we start thinking about it this way , it all changes .
as a kid , i was always comic books and stuff .
and in the course of journey of discovery , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
that &apos;s star night , i never seen that before .
our steps in life digitization was life were exponential .
another example is called virtual reality .
we have an abstract , an abstract ted language .
ant : i &apos;m a lawyer brand .
it &apos;s just stunning is yingly invely advisambitious .
for the two billion people , but it &apos;s a disaster .
and of course , as how design is is imon the perception perceptions perception .
so , how does do to things .
that means that the criminal rates crime going back .
, like that ?
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
i working in a coing -- dangerous .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
... it &apos;s paying attention to crowdsourcing .
it could be done in a time .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental disconnect .
they put them on the ventilation breathing machine .
she had suffered from no unable damage damage .
meanwhile , there &apos;s political disposition ction in our country .
and this is the machine age .
it used to happen like it was to happen in the village .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
i said , &quot; chicken p? &quot;
ask , ask , the evidence , demand for evidence .
i know what people think when they see that .
ok , think of it extreme as extreme self-motivation .
but we know very little bit about where things are going .
there &apos;s more than that it ; it goes even deeper .
and this is a really an extraordinary honor to me .
it was the misguided ged stance against drugs .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
and the fish was also fortunate enough be there .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity humanity .
or other models , or even technical cations .
this is an organism that we &apos;ve about in 1996 .
frosty , the carbon is cleaning clean up every day .
real-. it &apos;s time to accept reality .
if you want to get far , get together . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly the same thing i just described .
have you ever seen a climaneutral tree ?
because , , it &apos;s a fun process .
i was not &apos;t been there with miguel too not very long ago .
this was not a movie , no hd , that was real .
in fact , the advancing progress society is based on energy progress .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
we can put this machine on everything we want .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
but actually , that night it was even more fun .
the idea is to do off a digital security system .
click , umm , you &apos;re in this museum .
because the images made it more real for them .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities of reality .
but together , you can create something like this .
here &apos;s a quick video clip of what we &apos;re doing .
marthylrat ? yes alive ? yap .

inotar is a certificfication site .
it was called the automatically &quot; rock . &quot;
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
it caused enormous immense oy jug in the control room .
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow ch the sun .
in 25 years , it will be gone from here to here .
that &apos;s quite substantial remarkable number of people around worldwide worldwide .
so i know some people who not contributed involved .
takes about a thousand wind .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
he lived for a years old years old .
the music is the expansion of our body .
but in the &apos; 80s , it wasn &apos;t way .
and then they whole bunch of simulations .
and so he capes ws out of his states .
the shrimp will eating the phytopton .
it &apos;s this bitthat joint ing , coordinflavor .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
this is not a business , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
so i step back and i get perspective of view .
we &apos;re going it in the opening sequence of the movie .
and it was an experience that i couldn &apos;t hollywood to me to hollywood .
well , the power of energy has fallen over time .
this is one variant of one thing that was done .
dium , robes , child paralysis ...
you can just name a couple of names and people will understand .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds about pain in their pain pain .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
can you imagine a something something that comes out of tobacco ?
in other words , play is our adaptive joker .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
when we &apos;re building , cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
we can actually do the same things actually with less energy .
so we &apos;d better to figure out what the goal is .
i filmed in the war zones areas -- difficult and dangerous .
&apos;s a lot of stories about why we this .
but what if you want to see the paintbrstrikes ?
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
as you can see , these are not three images .
i &apos;m always starting a sketch , an idea .
so , in some way , the way technology is outdoes excescraps us .
she was a weapon , strong woman , she impact .
my grandfather was in japrison during the prohibi.
the brows still describe them as pristine .
a few years ago , i started developing littits .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
you have to admit that &apos;s a big choice .
why are you going to round around us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
it &apos;s also my , long life of love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that this will ever change .
you follow me , because the circle will to circle again .
and the predictions as you &apos;ve read them are serious .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
and also , we &apos;re still very , very strong in to stories .
is the time when you fall in love with .
and as we grow , we of windles are as we get bigger .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound t .
i have a friend who drives ves a passenger i . &quot;
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
he &apos;s a biologist at veta la palma .
what we need a lot of companies that . hundreds .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
they go to thabo mbeki in south africa .
this is it &apos;s an idiosyntic debate . it &apos;s to stop .
there &apos;s no other description for &apos;s going on here .
and my talk today will to mainprimarily ly by these cognitive cases .
i mean , how much we eat from our memories ?
and this is an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
we need to start to transform the real world into a game .
and i can tell you , it was a transformative .
i was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology .
these are the kinds of questions that we need to face .
i like to smile and i say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
imagine images could really start to fly .
one of my friends did it -- richard bingbird fe .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a lot about transparency now .
open the map , and kive with a click .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
but my logical side page didn &apos;t either .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
fifty percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing the ground .
ohh , ww !
if a neighbor can help helping the other , we &apos;re enhwe strengthen our communities .

i just want to just briebit about salad resssing .
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
like algae -- and other scary other ghtening ary things .
i &apos;m not good enough , i can &apos;t do it . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to replace the oil with other energy ers .
and also , what you would think would be in the mind today .
and then i can immediately me , and that &apos;s unfair .
so the brush the gut , the better the system . &quot;
i mentioned this to miguel and he was kidding .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
because they &apos;re the ones those who are also experts for flavor .
so , i &apos;d better be a nine in the beginning of my death .
that &apos;s a lot of death masses , 20 an hour .
i mean , we ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to that very much . thank you
the more money you earn deserve the more happy you are .

i have this &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be done this .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
for example , this would be somebody who is completely logical .
my mother , my sister and i eping in the same bed .
second , the photos should have the same type of light ting .
and yeah , i have a task , as you might recognize .
right , bryan , the judge has magic .
ten minutes later , the judge announquit a break .
that all of us survival is linked the individual to survive every survival .
we have the capital of technoropy .
and then they wanted to kill them , because they could well .
but you &apos;re in a foreign ?
there are a series of photographs of here &apos;s there they are .
that &apos;s this is the publication we &apos;ve it just finished recently .
this is at about 20 feet high meters of sea level as greenland .
we &apos;ve moved in what we call the bird age .
i can say the canadian ler is a man .
he has a food from 15 to one .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
a very concreintense desire wish that we to invent this technology .
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
well , your herself is not going to be happier .
so there &apos;s no excuse me here in this audience .
since that time , we &apos;ve gotten all kinds of recognition .
this approach in with anything we can new things that that we do .
it was exclusive she could do it .
&quot; because you &apos;ve kept you this morning , &quot; he said .
and they light the way through the rest of book .
i &apos;ve tried to something about our legal system .
in 2010 , we had just been connected , we two billion people online .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a bat &apos;s 300 .
and all the i was ed collecting more and more .
i studied a woman printer , and she was breathing .
and that was the first time i ever learned this .
i know now know it &apos;s was the cause the sea .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some some of the ones .
we &apos;ve for three years .
and that &apos;s not just resource efficiency , but efficiency .
yeah , &apos;s what you one down there &apos;s a load the load there .
and i immediately different pattern that &apos;s .
so got me , and i wanted more .
the fact is that this uncertainty should be worried to worry about about .
you know , there were no mandarins in paradise .
you can trick this to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
they &apos;re interacting with with , and their experiences .
today i want to tell you today about circles and revelations .
there &apos;s a lot of many more than , but i have time .
each of these issues course , many , many and lots of smaller decisions .
and this video was actually been sent already passed in january .
and the next interesting phase was going take another billion years .
the invention of language , for example , was a little step in that direction direction .
even if you who kills someone is not just a murderer ler .
a couple of few months went over , and i just forgotten everything .
depending on their behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
a consequence of that was that the phone was never broken .
b has the benefits and the risks . what do you want to do ?
this is is how people the way in really thought about a long time on creativity .
and all of a sudden , he no longer seem to appear to be humanhuman .
was the same , the bad team of one of the best .
how do we translate those feelings into into reality ?
players are masters at on spiders of social nets .
when you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re people attract other happy other happy people .
obviously , all &apos;t going to into my tiny suitcase .
and i celebrate , i cry like child .
and the more open i was talking , the more i should say .
a government is absolutely necessary government , but it it has to get more efficient .
and of course , there &apos;t can never be them in germany . &quot;
they &apos;re that &apos;s all of the sort of the wave direction .
now , where are we going to go , what &apos;s the right approach ?
my great-grandparents all died when they were 60 .
and i don &apos;t mean less successful , even though that &apos;s part of it to that .
or want to be fitter , be stronger , have more power .
is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going &apos;ll talk about about in a minute .
an amazing mistake of error in rate . one in nine innocent .
and then people could eat this and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they &apos;re in , they want to the end of the gang .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black guy than boy as a client .
we used to things that happen fashion linear .
this is somebody , who surely ely four from 10 .
very rarely , you actually witness a rolling ice iceberg .
so i want to you two , maybe three examples .
they can kick them away where they go and you stand .
there &apos;s only the second best , the fire department department .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he has no soul .
welcome to . fear . call come the risk .
bryan stevenson : well , there are ways tions everywhere .
they that by erating ing the country .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean coal technology .
so the device that here you see there , that &apos;t work .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
the things that are just go into technical systems .
and as i turn around , the fingers is changing its position .
you there ? you look a little nervous .
it was a store that was called the &apos;s .
so , if you could turn the lights on .
and then so let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we &apos;ve just outlandexceded ved the 7-billion-billion brand .
so it &apos;t changed , and yet everything has changed .
but wait , this is really is my favorite project .
and i think it &apos;s going to makes the world look like this .
secondly , what economists call oppersicost .
i apologize that i have to cut down so much .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting is that of vision .
we see this that phosphorus is really critical .
so , of the things that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
so there &apos;s a direct line ightforward system for this .
now , how do you start talking about speak of the language of music ?
&apos;s losing half of his first half first year .
and in berlin there was a crazy collective of engineering .
we &apos;re talking about the flight of the information overload plus .
and i convinced them to fund an expedition .
it has moments moments of life , one after another .
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
i just wish i could see my kids up .
it looks pretty much like the ancient fashion , fashiable mupossible assembly language .
and what happened was that i needed to an expert .
now , where would you posiput your brain that scale ?
now , cats look at cats are looking at this video .
and sure enough can find fast food chain .
the design software usually takes a few years .
because is where the actual government is actually happening .
we need to go to engage in of the government .
the cost of solar power was by 50 percent .
i sent them home without home without talking to speak with my physician doctor .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
and i guess a lot of you did have done this that too .
i believe that in it this , and i feel like we should this .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s smwell .
how many doors do the house that you they live in ?
and some other examples another example are the ambitious , smart systems .
but also , our own perception , how does it deceive us .
so that &apos;s why they &apos;re this , ask , ask people for the people .
i &apos;m going to explain what those sounds sound might have to mean .
the conventional system looks like this in the world .
and then we started negotiating with the insulanders .
&quot; 2.5 to what ? what do you feed ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to ask that .
does it one depending ongs to of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
look at mighum guel , farmers like miguel .
so the program that i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
our imagination is a force that can even a reality .
and we shouldn &apos;t do that . either . our health system is mies .
there were no christmas . we did all of this .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think i think .
if we looked at how feelings variate with income .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
i &apos;m saying that we are to take ready for our own epic game .
again , what potential do we want to call back right now ?
which one would you like to have if you could only have one ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in your genes ?
and if she didn &apos;t moving , you &apos;ve have been buried it .
so i &apos;m going to show you very much exactly what brought you .
so they &apos;re moving around and they do art installations like this .
the previous example was about finding some details .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is what &apos;s fantastic .
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logic logical page side says .
do you know how many decisions do you make a typical week ?
a typical wal-mart offers you 100,000 products today .
today , we don &apos;t just find about something we &apos;re doing .
i knew that she had come to come to get bye .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
because their life depended on whether they were doing the job .
because all these new technologies from now of these are feeding on themselves .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
i went through the emergency department in my way home .
i was shocked and decked into the inside .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
and it turns out that dna synthesidna .
i started thinking to think that i should just should just come on the project .
but i &apos;ve just been it a little bit curious yet yet .
and first of all of asking first ask , what &apos;s the right thing is .
because the music is a language , and there &apos;s a language to communicate there language .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he deceived you .
this first one , this was more like a passionate monkey affaircraft key .
this second fish , which a different kind of love story .
a fish up a fish , but also a bird reserve .
this was what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
there &apos;s a band-step direcadverge ction there .
we &apos;re going to meet a few more the next few days .
what it ruined was the memories of the experience .
now , the reminder bering self is a storyteller .
we think about our future as predictable memories .
we know that money is very important , and the goals is very important .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not sure that .
in most of my work , , i have two ts .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what &apos;s going on inside .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s about 30 from the feet , or feet .
but there was always a life cycle of life in their presentations .
that keeps us , and let us continue keep growing up evolve .
the epiphvelation is that death is a part of life .
the pilot ran out the machine after the hudson river .
i &apos;ve never &apos;t have a ever been going two years with my wife .
so the driving force behind this is cyber-superpower .
so , can you help me ? i need help .
do you know how many decisions do you make on a typical day ?
and we found that there was actually a relationship there .
the words , as long as his friends , now joked his .
it possible impossible to tell the photograph was put together .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the as a platform .
we have a lot of cells that are not left own anymore .
now , it &apos;s a pretty quite an amazing invention when you think about it .
it was the fear of terror that formed her life .
more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
yet , but we &apos;re still going to the galapagos .
and these pictures are extraordinary , the transition is very fast .
but you &apos;t take the previous lospriest loss lostrue .
they put a blue one green , and you can make light .
and you say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
she said it was like a thal of air .
am i look like i could just up a song ?
so when i put them next to de-by-side , that &apos;s what you have to take your your interest .
and they lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
so , for example , shlet the environment , get less car .
of course , we can look at the first arbage .
so the question is , how do we deal with these wind ?
and so , in every , you can get things back .
and she asked him , &quot; what are your hobbi@@
but , of course , the sum whole , a lot of ideas .
you can like to test it for talk in your rooms .
it turns out question of whether you can get this to zero .
does one in the audience ever see anyone of masks die ?
please don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have no consequences .
most of you are completely ignored by the memory themselves .
so you can ask , how happy is the living itself ?
if the museum gave us the picture , you click on click on it .
just too , time-time they agree with you .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges they have to face .
so today , evolution can happen in the sptime of microseconds .
so we &apos;ve been wed the tized the time scales .
i thought that technology should make it possible and not kill .
sometimes i lose the balance . a i &apos;ll end a story .
i want to end with a story that really excited about ed with this .
because we protected areas , we &apos;re basically returning ing the past .
and the online criminal motives are very easy to understand .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to get worse .
maybe this is an artificial way to an e-book .
there &apos;s a ma. i don &apos;t know what it is .
this is the source of most of the coal in west virginia .
the most powerful mining worker is the head of massey coal .
if we extend it , we can put back a little bit .
when you walk , every footprint is pressure destroys the ground .
and interestingly , bono is a ted inner .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it much later .
most people start to set themselves in the task of the task .
they evaporate their greaturine . they almost never do that .
we found this in the the happiness of the living itself .
that &apos;s going going to affect change policy , i think , in the next .
and that &apos;s an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going on go to .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal
think of this as a point , as a visual point point .
so the writings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
i was the only one person to talk to the airstriactors on on .
but in my humanity , i also given to gave my ego room
it &apos;s almost like prepare preparing for all our lives .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it &apos;s way .
you &apos;ve got have to make 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
but where would the next aed be to be to help this patient ?
and what &apos;s below that is what we call bureaucracy .
we all need to end up to believe that things that we can &apos;t see .
innovation , creativity , and development is not not just coming come out of just from our heads .
so let me just end just with you with my words of my own words : i remember .
we think are cases of cases , inotar .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened in the case of digotar .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation to ties .
this is a whole book , an example of ular data .
we can move from a poster to a physical view of this environment .
the way to maximize freedom is maximize choice .
i &apos;m going to give you some of examples of what &apos;s enabling modern progress .
economists call this a pareto-improvements ation .
we take pictures of these minibig -big bang we &apos;re in the detectors .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
then the same thing as happens in a good , well-appropriate ed conversation .
because he doesn &apos;t know what the hoopile of the day he &apos;s going to do first .
let &apos;s call him miguel . in fact actually &apos;s called the miguel .
here he is &apos;s pigaping out a rare tap ar here .
so the question is , we do that ? i think so .
and we can be a term , we can use the word &quot; intersexuality .
i mean , what do bring to do with so many outfits ?
that &apos;s the average size of a greenland ice sheliceberg .
it &apos;s called eyewriter , and you can see the description .
i became a miracle of not to die that day .
i really like your kind of sergey gebry brin . now .
so you can see , film , we wanted to tell the real version .
they don &apos;t think they &apos;re even come from the museums .
car color , outdoor color of the car -- i have 56 million possibilities .
he said , &quot; there are death penalty in germany .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
the less i think , think about it , the more intuitive it is .
of course , we could reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
that , we &apos;re useful , we &apos;re not harmful .
they feel that &apos;s the truth behind the outdoor line .
they now have a fifteen percent renewable energy
but while you &apos;ve been talking to different people around the world about these possibilities .
and is the value of experience , such as simple exercise .
that &apos;s &apos;s sc, and we should be ashamed .
and if you can do , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
we produce make roandrogen and we &apos;re talking to androgens .
tempt will be part of the show , which is pretty deceted .
let &apos;s quickly jump to moma , again in new york .
how did he get to look for help in this particular way ?
and that means free access , which &apos;s &apos;s open and productive .
wr want to help people who have been judgvicted of ty .
and i thought that was , it &apos;s going to get so hard , so painful .
this is y-supported innovation that we have today .
and the best part that is possibly be what we expect us in in health .
but the question that i want to throw up is , why not ?
i want to help you to a very specific certain aspect of curiosity .
i &apos;m true can realize the breathe audience , consciously or unconscious .
now he &apos;s talking about the minerals of phytoplankton .
you &apos;re just wrong , and some people people don &apos;t .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy how little that is supported .
they &apos;re investing a lot of their time in their structures and their structure construction .
the first of these cases is tradiction to adding complexity .
bonobos , with chimpanzees are our clostives .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the speed .
you &apos;re about the block and you take it as an epiphvelation .
but i don &apos;t know how receiving gient people will be .
this deputy went through over to the way older black .
is one of the evidence , by the way , that men are not pigs .
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of consito think about it .
ceos are a bit about average . here &apos;s what gets interesting .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design and play and play with these like this .
and i really to show you my outit this week .
i didn &apos;t learn this way , as a lawyer .
the jujudge looks at him as an adult , but i see a child .
and within a few years , lego , to every household .
i &apos;m going to something here . we &apos;re looking right the center .
so i decided , when i was 15 , to become a diver .
example , this billion points , i think .
fireflies in a glass of fireflies , i always found all very exciting .
from my eye , , i looked at the janitand and down .
the x-interpretation of a piece of the is comparable .
many of you , , they &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s good .
there was a long time , there were were whales -- 500 years ago .
that means that the player &apos;s probably beat three out of 10 beats .
6 : social decline . admit: 65 : dead .
new investment to create new well-paid jobs .
and they did this with what we ad maps .
that is , means it &apos;s about efficiency , not not about efficiency .
okay , let me pull out a blood for you .
imagine that every single one is being controlled by people .
and guess what we found in the attack ?
if you look at the people you have to do with ...
how about some of the examples that we can &apos;t even predict ?
but instead of getting into zing panicked , he just up .
and that &apos;s also what i &apos;ve had over the last half a year .
but somehow we &apos;re able to exploit away from this problem .
he invited the king of siam from me to dinner to the dinner .
this is what struck me when i wanted to reout my jeans .
it means that we have a cultural impact on ongside the science .
and these are just the biohackers , the individual people .
so i &apos;ve been looking at , when is natural or natural or intuitive .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true true .
i first eaten ate him in a restaurant in southern spain .
what about children paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
we hate a lot too much government . we don &apos;t have no trust in the system .
we &apos;re hiding to escape the suffering of the real world .
we degraa person who has a value for our society .
we bed his bed so that he can see outside .
so here you see here a clip from this code of attack .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leader .
so maybe you might little bit before the interview . &quot;
this is my brand in my little , distored industry .
i like things that are kind of . i like weird things .
so this airport alone has a surface of 100 square kilometers .
turned it arbage on the side . went home .
the death penalty in america is defined ror .
it was always so inspiring , so it was ing .
because ultimately , our humanity has depends on our all humanity .
56 percent of all rape rapes don &apos;t go the court .
well , in fact , the number of violent cri&apos;t that much .
i couldn &apos;t &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t let myself down .
and if we can , we can we start the chromosome ?
so , this looks like a basketball plabillord yoff .
finally , one solution , which that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
this has only accepted only about two thousand really eight really form , these networks .
i think , kind of like that or something .
so , i think think &apos;s a very happy hack .
this goes back to , much more back to the pre-ancient industrial cultures .
and six milliseconds , also an interesting phenomenon .
it takes no longer need to whistle a song or singsing it .
and this is a that time , an anecdott that you might about .
there was the core research site called leoshado.
i asked him about how become a kind an expert like this .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s self-reis completely new new .
now , i wondered , well , how do i really get through this ?
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
there &apos;s of a tremendous wave of happiness in happiness , among researchers .
now , the living self its life continuously .
now , the two types of self are throwing up two terms of happiness .
our gut is a wonderful , hofriendly friendly environment for these bacteria .
but a lot of people get caught in a very strange position .
i &apos;ve brought seven ses , and that &apos;s all .
but , all of that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange land highway .
so it turns out to be all of all these extensions .
the biggest scared fear they were afraid rations , rape and death .
pictures like this : along a much dried road .
somebody in , and he had thumly hacked the system .
on the contrary opposite , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view world .
it &apos;s an independent area . you &apos;re all the minerals al resources .
and it &apos;s just that the answer to the question is it .
you increase the paralysis and you get the happiness .
in fact , the has shown shown that there are lot of them out there .
there was , i think a good code .
the interesting thing is , if i can take a little trip here .
and i &apos;m not sure that they &apos;re really are viating .
the composer is and more to your friend that you live with .
so finally , there was a who was trying get it right .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building on entially , not intense .
i grew up with a loved nice portion science fiction .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons everybody on the planet .
they were producing produced the highest construction in the very a little time .
&apos;s really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
a couple of , probably . probably about the as many of there are creative people here .
is actually the ation of human and machine .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
that &apos;s this is what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
well , at that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate now ? &quot;
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s is completely unconstraints .
why is it important to start reboot ? what is the red ?
an eight-ght-wing , a brand . what &apos;s your brand ?
and finally so , in the , we should welcome the fear .
so i went that about this year that i did years ago , i did a few years ago .
possibilities that would not wouldn &apos;t have not been allowed to were explicitly encouraged .
for example , the fish was taken on a glorium on trip .
so you find programs that are the most likely to use the of numbers .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynbs .
how can a judge can transform one person judge into something that &apos;s &apos;s not ?
how about how to with a set of new , belongs before .
, the emphasis crete was block had become the building block of our time .
54 percent of the deaths were ing .
the modern industrial world as we know it &apos;s is not 300 years old .
should i answer the to this ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
at the last ted conference , i was going introduction to the hc .
and then we created a coof the fice ct .
so this is just an application of many of you can do with it .
that is &apos;re , you navigating and sound , on rhythm .
then the remaiment influences of the pre-industrial complex industrial cultures .
the notes are same have the function of a writing writing .
i , how artially competent was this diagnosis ?
this is a fish up in the southwest of spain .
it &apos;s the renewables , as they are often called .
smallpox have killed billions of people on the planet .
now , what does this have to do with placebo effect ?
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s about returned 2,500 years .
well , the majority . i like to think of that , as a physician .
but nothing was invented that would let me go back , so far .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and that urgency , that goal , has really changed my life .
and if they &apos;re at risk , really bad things can happen .
so what does that context of to the thoughts and the feelings about yourself ?
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
this is my wrestage age . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
a kid in india , &quot; i &apos;ve seen monkey . &quot;
i gave a &apos;ve given some a few talks about the death penalalty in germany .
so the dramatic come in the mates .
and that &apos;s where i made first mistake , i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular panel audio .
i looked in the rubs cks , and it was a little bit of plittle ink .
some some of my novels es have happened over in the last five years .
and the best part of all this is that they connect with magnets .
and the key indicator or this is the extinction of languages .
it &apos;s our new home , and it &apos;s called nunch vist .
now , this is actually live on the internet . you can check it .
most people know most people know about this from the software field .
even if you shoot , you would have emissions .
you learn to find the notes on the notes on the instrument .
there was no ch&apos;t have been no piano at the piano , as an instrument .
this one day , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful .
so i offered a $ 10,000 dollars in software for the winner .
so i want to this machine , and i want to go to future .
and soon , i wrote an article on genetically enginetically-tically modified food .
she &apos;s in the present in the moment , but we have an incredible opportunity .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a phstudent .
we &apos;re becoming into collaborative , thinking , heart beings .
and &apos;s called androleceptor defect .
and i had to explain to the journalists , that there &apos;s no this test .
some other odds about what their rights are .
so all these green areas , these are the most ambitious est environments .
these people are going to be connected in the for forever .
and that so this is actually includes just just a period of a two-and-a-of a second period .
well , finally , the film has a very large momentum .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say , thank you ted .
and it &apos;s spread out wirelessly , organic , of course .
and so why i think that the ted community should be tehandper .
if lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
i think that too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .

in a sense , the arctic ice is the beating heart of our global climate system .
you know , tv or a washing machine , they use it , they don &apos;t use it .
we just wanted to know , what about what a normal , roly electrochemical ?
that means , 15popounds of pounds of wild fish are you need to get a pound of tuna tuna .

why not have the muscle fiber optics fibers that will enable them to run faster and faster and longer ?
so maybe , we might shoe , and it &apos;s he will be the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever ried ...
and i think the most important point this is that we &apos;ve stopped talking about talking to our patients .
so , make the methods techniques that are easy to use and start with this one , to hug in the team .
we say , &quot; computers , please , please generalize a million randomized random sequence of instructions construction .
so the challenging that we decided to explore the answer , and we developed create seafdozable ables .
i can accelerate speed up the whole sequence by tipping the pace in one way or another .
and so , the interest in this this technology , i further into this .
all of this requires the ability to take our ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
so this is &apos;s a whole range of things that you &apos;re looking to be involved with the next ongside ide by the side of your existence .
is called a form of law some psychology ology , which is that affects in perception perception .

there &apos;s a fluid reactor that seems a little bit , but maybe that about us .
and so i thought , this was an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned converted it into a design workshop .
people are covering p in their faith , so tightly that they can &apos;t it .
now , if i had opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
i found the time that i spent in that hospital just -- except for physiological my physical therapy .
evolution is all about the genome to the next generation , adaptation generation after generation .
well , just to conclude , i want to a lot about the fathers .
if you surround around with the right people , you &apos;re not only understand it , you will appreciate it .
so doing things like this -- you know , people reminds ks -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
